// invoice PDF (which people forward to accountants), sits in surl/furl query
// strings and browser history, and is visible in the PayU dashboard. If
// "I know a paid txnid" were enough to be handed the buyer's download
// token, anyone who ever saw an invoice could take the file. So /api/payment/
// create-order also sets a small httpOnly cookie holding a signed
// `<orderId>.<mac>` entry for each order this browser created, and the token
// is only ever revealed to a browser that can present the matching entry.
// Everyone else gets "paid — check your email" instead.
